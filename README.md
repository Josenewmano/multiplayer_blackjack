# multiplayer_blackjack
A command line version of blackjack, built in Ruby.

No secrecy, no bluffing, all the cards are on the table. Mika is my infant son. He probably wouldn't condone gambling. Aces are wild - of course! (This wasn't actually true initially).

The method for moving players' information from the 'final' array to the places hash, is long and repetitive. This needs work.

There are no automated tests. The game was based on a very early Makers project which was built without automated testing, and then gradually adapted from that. The code was tested manually extensively - real life gameplay! Specific tests for edits were also managed by editing the 'deal' method, to give specfic cards out, and monitor the results.
